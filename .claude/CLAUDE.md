# Reluma/Eonlife Universal E-Commerce Platform

## Architecture
- Multi-tenant (one codebase, multiple brands)
- Atomic design (atoms → molecules → organisms)
- Test-driven development (tests before code)
- Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Prisma + Stripe

## Current Focus: Phase 1
- Setting up testing infrastructure
- Building component library with TDD
- Database multi-tenant refactor

## Coding Standards
- TypeScript strict mode
- Functional React components only
- 80% minimum test coverage
- Vitest + Testing Library
